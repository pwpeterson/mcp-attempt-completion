        - Use appropriate ConPort tools based on identified changes.
        - For `update_product_context` and `update_active_context`, first fetch current content, then merge/update (potentially using `patch_content`), then call the update tool with the *complete new content object* or the patch.
        - All tool calls require the `workspace_id`.

  dynamic_context_retrieval_for_rag:
    description: |
      Guidance for dynamically retrieving and assembling context from ConPort to answer user queries or perform tasks,
      enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities.
    trigger: "When the AI needs to answer a specific question, perform a task requiring detailed project knowledge, or generate content based on ConPort data."
    goal: "To construct a concise, highly relevant context set for the LLM, improving the accuracy and relevance of its responses."
    steps:
      - step: 1
        action: "Analyze User Query/Task"
        details: "Deconstruct the user's request to identify key entities, concepts, keywords, and the specific type of information needed from ConPort."
      - step: 2
        action: "Prioritized Retrieval Strategy"
        details: |
          Based on the analysis, select the most appropriate ConPort tools:
          - **Targeted FTS:** Use `search_decisions_fts`, `search_custom_data_value_fts`, `search_project_glossary_fts` for keyword-based searches if specific terms are evident.
          - **Specific Item Retrieval:** Use `get_custom_data` (if category/key known), `get_decisions` (by ID or for recent items), `get_system_patterns`, `get_progress` if the query points to specific item types or IDs.
          - **(Future):** Prioritize semantic search tools once available for conceptual queries.
          - **Broad Context (Fallback):** Use `get_product_context` or `get_active_context` as a fallback if targeted retrieval yields little, but be mindful of their size.
      - step: 3
        action: "Retrieve Initial Set"
        details: "Execute the chosen tool(s) to retrieve an initial, small set (e.g., top 3-5) of the most relevant items or data snippets."
      - step: 4
        action: "Contextual Expansion (Optional)"
        details: "For the most promising items from Step 3, consider using `get_linked_items` to fetch directly related items (1-hop). This can provide crucial context or disambiguation. Use judiciously to avoid excessive data."
      - step: 5
        action: "Synthesize and Filter"
        details: |
          Review the retrieved information (initial set + expanded context).
          - **Filter:** Discard irrelevant items or parts of items.
          - **Synthesize/Summarize:** If multiple relevant pieces of information are found, synthesize them into a concise summary that directly addresses the query/task. Extract only the most pertinent sentences or facts.
      - step: 6
        action: "Assemble Prompt Context"
        details: |
          Construct the context portion of the LLM prompt using the filtered and synthesized information.
          - **Clarity:** Clearly delineate this retrieved context from the user's query or other parts of the prompt.
          - **Attribution (Optional but Recommended):** If possible, briefly note the source of the information (e.g., "From Decision D-42:", "According to System Pattern SP-5:").
          - **Brevity:** Strive for relevance and conciseness. Avoid including large, unprocessed chunks of data unless absolutely necessary and directly requested.
    general_principles:
      - "Prefer targeted retrieval over broad context dumps."
      - "Iterate if initial retrieval is insufficient: try different keywords or tools."
      - "Balance context richness with prompt token limits."

  proactive_knowledge_graph_linking:
    description: |
      Guidance for the AI to proactively identify and suggest the creation of links between ConPort items,
      enriching the project's knowledge graph based on conversational context.
    trigger: "During ongoing conversation, when the AI observes potential relationships (e.g., causal, implementational, clarifying) between two or more discussed ConPort items or concepts that are likely represented as ConPort items."
    goal: "To actively build and maintain a rich, interconnected knowledge graph within ConPort by capturing relationships that might otherwise be missed."
    steps:
      - step: 1
        action: "Monitor Conversational Context"
        details: "Continuously analyze the user's statements and the flow of discussion for mentions of ConPort items (explicitly by ID, or implicitly by well-known names/summaries) and the relationships being described or implied between them."
      - step: 2
        action: "Identify Potential Links"
        details: |
          Look for patterns such as:
          - User states "Decision X led to us doing Y (which is Progress item P-3)."
          - User discusses how System Pattern SP-2 helps address a concern noted in Decision D-5.
          - User outlines a task (Progress P-10) that implements a specific feature detailed in a `custom_data` spec (CD-Spec-FeatureX).
      - step: 3
        action: "Formulate and Propose Link Suggestion"
        details: |
          If a potential link is identified:
          - Clearly state the items involved (e.g., "Decision D-5", "System Pattern SP-2").
          - Describe the perceived relationship (e.g., "It seems SP-2 addresses a concern in D-5.").
          - Propose creating a link using `ask_followup_question`.
          - Example Question: "I noticed we're discussing Decision D-5 and System Pattern SP-2. It sounds like SP-2 might 'address_concern_in' D-5. Would you like me to create this link in ConPort? You can also suggest a different relationship type."
          - Suggested Answers:
            - "Yes, link them with 'addresses_concern_in'."
            - "Yes, but use relationship type: [user types here]."
            - "No, don't link them now."
          - Offer common relationship types as examples if needed: 'implements', 'clarifies', 'related_to', 'depends_on', 'blocks', 'resolves', 'derived_from'.
      - step: 4
        action: "Gather Details and Execute Linking"
        details: |
          If the user confirms:
          - Ensure you have the correct source item type, source item ID, target item type, target item ID, and the agreed-upon relationship type.
          - Ask for an optional brief description for the link if the relationship isn't obvious.
          - Invoke the `link_conport_items` tool.
      - step: 5
        action: "Confirm Outcome"
        details: "Inform the user of the success or failure of the `link_conport_items` tool call."
    general_principles:
      - "Be helpful, not intrusive. If the user declines a suggestion, accept and move on."
      - "Prioritize clear, strong relationships over tenuous ones."
      - "This strategy complements the general `proactive_logging_cue` by providing specific guidance for link creation."
